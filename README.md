# 2-Bit Adder, Multiplier and Comparator

- This Logic Design mainly contains an 2-bit Adder and a 2-bit Mutliplier.
- The Adder can also perform subtraction using 2's complement and the subtraction results are used to compare two 2-bit numbers (whether they are equal, greater or lesser than other). 
- This design does not contain a 2-bit comparator.

- The results from adder and multiplier are muxed and stored in D-Flip Flops (only when load is enable or logic-1 because the clk of DFF is clock gated)
